## spitball

A very simple gem package generation tool built on `bundler`. Pass it a
gem file, it spits out a tarball of the generated gem
environment. Perfect for "bundle once, upload everywhere"-style
deployment.

Also comes with `spitball-server`, a small sinatra app that you can run
on a dedicated build server. The `spitball` command line client can then
pull packages down from said server.
